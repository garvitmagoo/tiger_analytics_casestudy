# React + Vite

-> Clone the repo with git clone https://github.com/garvitmagoo/tiger_analytics_casestudy.git

-> Change directory to project to cd tiger_analytics_casestudy

-> Install Node modules npm i

-> Run thr project - npm start 

-> That's it !

-> I have tried to create a clean and modular code , created few custom hooks to extract some logic. Added some basic validation to form and npinline editing in the table. 
There is still scope for improvement in the UI and enhancements . Could add a few features like real-time collaboration using WebSockets if given some time in future.
